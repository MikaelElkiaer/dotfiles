# Bootstrapping

This assumes that a running version of EndeavourOS has already been installed - it does not need to be a fresh installation.
First step is to clone this repo, e.g.:

`mkdir -p ~/Repositories/GitHub && git clone https://github.com/MikaelElkiaer/dotfiles ~/Repositories/GitHub/dotfiles && cd ~/Repositories/GitHub/dotfiles`

Second step is to run the `install.sh` script:

`./install.sh`
