# Bootstrapping

This assumes that a running version of EndeavourOS has already been installed - it does not need to be a fresh installation.
First step is to clone this repo, e.g.:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Repositories/GitHub \
  && git clone -b endeavouros https://github.com/MikaelElkiaer/dotfiles ~/Repositories/GitHub/dotfiles \
  && cd ~/Repositories/GitHub/dotfiles
```
